# Accident-severity
This project aims to use data to explore Accident severity Traffic and to build a model thatcan predict its future.

# Introduction/Business understanding:
In an effort to reduce the frequency of car collisions in a community, an algorithim must be developed to predict the severity of an accident given the current weather, road and visibility conditions. When conditions are bad, this model will alert drivers to remind them to be more careful.

# Data Understanding:
Our predictor or target variable will be 'SEVERITYCODE' because it is used measure the severity of an accident from 0 to 5 within the dataset. Attributes used to weigh the severity of an accident are 'WEATHER', 'ROADCOND' and 'LIGHTCOND'.

Severity codes are as follows:

      0. Little to no Probability(Clear Conditions)


      1. Very Low Probability - Chance or Property Damage.

      2. Low Probability - chance of Injury.

      3. Mild Probability - Chance of Serious Injury.

      4. High Probability - Chance of Fatality.
